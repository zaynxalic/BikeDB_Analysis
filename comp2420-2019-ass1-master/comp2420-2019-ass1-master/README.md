## Using the repository

  1. Fork the repository. Use the *fork* icon on the top of the page
     to do so. You will find that the forked repository has a name similar to
     the main one, except that it starts with your student id.

  2. Add your tutor as a *Developer* member.  There will be a default user
     called comp2420-2019-marker.  *DO NOT* remove this user.

  3. Clone the repository so that you get a local copy.  You might need to
     install git on your machine, especially if you are using Windows as your
     OS. Look at the assignment page for instructions.

  4. Work on your local copy.  Commit your work regularly.  Push you work
     to the your forked repository regularly.
